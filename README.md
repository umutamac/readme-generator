### Installation
Clone the repo down. Then open up a terminal where the index.js file is in, and run "npm install" to install the dependencies.

### Usage
This app asks for a title, description, installation guide, user guide, license type, creators email and GitHub username, GitHub username of any collaborators, and for any additional information. Then, it uses a template literal to put the answers into a markdown file template. If successful, the app creates a "readme.md" file in the project folder.
